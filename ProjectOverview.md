# Project overview

  This project is about creating an app that can guide college student by giving them resources specifc to their school instructors and classes
  
# Problem

  Students need more insight into that classes that they are going to be taking, There is also an issue of finding good resources for specific instructors. Resources like study guides, hw help, and worksheets should be easily accessible. Each class that is taught by a different instructor is different, hence students should be able to adjust to their way of teaching . There should be an online community by the students in college that is focused on helping students with their classes. Students that dont have people to study with and cant get access to a tutor need a place where they can ask questions about their hw.


# Solution
  Build platform that is simple enough to use and is able to index data from colleges at a more granular level. By giving the student a platform to where they can ask questions that are specific to ther classes and proffesors. this would allow them to build up a community that is good enough to support themselves and other individuals who don't have tutors or friends to study with.
